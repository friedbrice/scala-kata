   * Given: a finite list of integers, return the smallest and the second smallest,
   *
   * When: your function is called on said list,
   *
   * Then: your function returns the smallest and next smallest elements as a tuple.
   *
   * Special Requirement: This function is trivial to implement using two list traversals.
   * Try to make your solution use only one list traversal (the hidden tests will
   * pass a series of VERY large lists to justify this design requirement.)
